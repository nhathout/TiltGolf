# TiltGolf

TiltGolf is a tilt-controlled golf game that runs on a BeagleBone with an attached LCD. An IMU senses tilt and a kernel-space driver streams those readings to the Qt game. The UI presents arcade-style menus and levels, while the physics layer keeps the golf ball rolling realistically around the different levels.

## Hardware & Software Stack
- **BeagleBone Black + LCD cape** – what the game renders on.
- **Custom IMU module** – `IMU.*` and the kernel driver provide filtered tilt angles.
- **Qt 5 widgets UI** – `main.cpp`, `MainWindow`, `MenuScreen`, and `GameScreen` deliver the UX optimized for touch.
- **Physics layer** – `PhysicsEngine.*`, `GameController.*`, and `GameView.*` synchronize IMU input with Box2D-style ball motion.

## Building the Qt Application
The checked-in `Makefile` was generated by `qmake` for the EC535 BeagleBone cross toolchain. If you are on that toolchain:

```bash
cd tiltgolf
make          # uses qmake-generated rules and the arm-linux-g++ compiler
```

For native desktop experimentation you can regenerate host build files:

```bash
cd tiltgolf
qmake tiltgolf.pro
make
./tiltgolf    # runs the Qt UI on your workstation
```

> ℹ️  Ensure Qt 5.15 (or later) development packages and a C++17-capable compiler are installed.

## Box2D Test Harness (Desktop Prototype)
The `Box2DTest.cpp` file is a lightweight SFML window that drives a Box2D world for tuning forces, damping, and collisions before pushing to hardware.

### Prerequisites
- Box2D 3.x headers/libraries available on your system (e.g., via package manager).
- SFML 2.5+ development packages (`sfml-graphics`, `sfml-window`, `sfml-system`).

### Build & Run
```bash
mkdir -p build
g++ -std=c++17 tiltgolf/Box2DTest.cpp -I/usr/include -o build/Box2DTest \
    $(pkg-config --cflags --libs sfml-graphics sfml-window sfml-system box2d)

./build/Box2DTest
```
